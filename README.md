# Renewable_Energy_and_Global_Economies

**Completed:**\
August 2023

**Overview:**\
This project uses information from several data sources, analyzes the information using python, and visualizes it using Tableau. The data sources used include the United States Geological Survey (via Kaggle), the International Energy Agency, and the United Nations. The data obtained were used to create the following hypotheses and led to answering the following questions.\ 

Hypotheses:
1. A higher GDP leads to a higher percentage of renewable energy production.
2. Geopolitics and economic factors significantly influence renewable energy production in a country.

Questions: 
1. Does the economic growth/ GDP of a country influence its renewable energy production?
2. How does a country’s population affect the production of its renewable energy?
3. What is the general percentage trend of renewable production vs non-renewable production?
4. How do education and public awareness affect the amount of renewable energy production in a country?
5. What role does the geography of a location play in determining the type of renewable energy that can be deployed?
6. How much of a country's energy budget goes towards each type of energy production?

Through the work of analyzing and visualizing the data, the following conclusions were found:
1. GDP plays a major role in the renewable energy production.
2. Population and education are associated with renewable energy output, but not necessarily driving factors.  Geography may play a role with some energy production, but does not seem significant.
3. There is a great amount of relation between the multiple variables, but more thorough statistical analysis would be needed for conclusive findings.


**My Work:**
- Combining and cleaning all data pertaining to the United Nations
- Creating preliminary visualizations to view the UN data in python
- Creating visualizations showing the relationships between all data using Tableau
